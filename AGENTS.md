Your task is to create a web app for the part 2 of an assignment, according to the documents in ./plans/.

## notes
- utilize `beans` for task management and planning
- make atomic commits, every small task should be committed
- if there are strangely no errors from the LSP, it's likely because the LSP is broken. find subsitudes (e.g. commands to lint)
