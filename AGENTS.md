Your task is to create a web app for the part 2 of an assignment, according to the documents in ./plans/.

## notes
- utilize `beans` for task management and planning. please update beans immediately after you're told to do a task, and after you've done a task.
- make atomic commits, every small task should be committed, even beans changes.
- use semantic commits, which is `type(optional scope): commit message`, like `feat: implement x feature`. use `chore(beans):` for beans changes.
- if there are strangely no errors from the LSP, it's likely because the LSP is broken. find subsitudes (e.g. commands to lint)
